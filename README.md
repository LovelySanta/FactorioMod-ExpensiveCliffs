Cliffs are tough to play with, for the die-hards I made them even thougher...
- Cliff settings are forced higher than default (but still playable)
- The recipe for the cliff explosives has changed (and for that altered the research tree accordingly)

*We put a stick in the cliffside, rap 500 explosive arround it with some wires, soak it in some acid, and have a nuke to set it off.*
